# thePlug - Sneaker Appa and Blog

This project was built as a final project upon completing coding bootcamp with DigitalCrafts Houston. The project was to build an app that showcased our strengths and what we've learned throughout the duration of the bootcamp. 

## Purpose

I chose my languages used to build this site based on the kind of projects I could see myself building in the future and I chose the theme of sneakers because I knew that it would be aesthetically pleasing to the viewers at our final demo day. This project was an extension of my previously built project [react-redux-Sneakerapp](https://github.com/gr8white/react-redux-SneakerApp). 

## Technologies

These are the technologies used to build this app:

* [React](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io) - An open source CSS framework based on Flexbox
* [Adobe Comp CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/comp.html) - Layout development tool
* [Contentful](contentful.com) - Web content management database


## Deployment

A live demo has been deployed at [here](https://gr8white.github.io/thePlug).

### Final Comments

When I first started brainstorming, I wanted to build a lot more into this project. I wanted to have working filters, user authentication, updated quantities after the checkout process, and a few other ideas that are listed here in my [project board](https://github.com/users/gr8white/projects/1) for the app. While I didn't finish all of my goals, I was able to walk away from this project knowing that my time spent was an amazing learning experience as a web developer. I spent the vast majority of my time debugging and rewriting sloppy code as I had to learn new components and approaches to React and Redux. In the end, I am proud of the developer that I became after completing this project and after completing the DigitalCrafts Bootcamp.
